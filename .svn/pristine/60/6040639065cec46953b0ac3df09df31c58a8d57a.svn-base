\red{\textbf{\LARGE Quick summary of what is below: we *must* send the final thesis manuscript to the reviewers on March 27. No exception whatsoever will be possible.}} \\

\underline{\textbf{\'Etat d'avancement de l'\'ecriture du manuscrit:}} \\

Chapter 1: Finished (final verification done by Joseph and Masaru on Feb 5, 2018).\\

Chapter 2: Finished (final verification done by Dimitri on Feb 5, 2018).\\

Chapter 3: Finished (final verification done by Dimitri on Feb 5, 2018). \\

Chapter 4: (Chapter about the 3D results): Not done yet, but several of the explanations and figures are in the ANIMMA paper. This chapter will be written during the 4-month extension funded by CEA (new results and new figures will then be produced). \\

Chapter 5: (Conclusions and future work): Not done yet. Will only be done when all the rest is finished, in particular after Chapter 4 is finished, since the conclusions will depend on what is found in the 3D results) \\

======================================

Here is the schedule made on February 7, at the meeting we had in Aix: \\

Since we have exactly 1 month and 19 days left, here is the workplan, with no possible exception: \\

- this week: finish entirely Chapters 1, 2 and 3 \\

- then, spend exactly 2 weeks and a half, starting next Monday (Feb 12), producing the figures showing 3D results; we *cannot* spend more time on that \\

- then, spend exactly 1 week and a half writing Chapter 4; with all the figures ready, this is not too difficult \\

- then, spend exactly 9 days writing Chapter 5 (Conclusions) \\

- then, spend a few days (4 or 5 days maximum) reading the whole thesis one last time, and then we send it to reviewers on Tuesday March 27. \\

By lack of time, we have no other possible choice for the calendar; no exception will be possible. \\

======================================
