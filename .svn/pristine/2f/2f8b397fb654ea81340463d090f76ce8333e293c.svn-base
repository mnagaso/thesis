\label{chap:6}

I would like to thank my thesis advisor, at first, Dr. Dimitri Komatitsch who provided me great amount skills/knowledge of high performance computing and wave propagation and his/his team's very sophisticated, greatly composed numerical code SPECFEM2D/3D that dynamically and rapidly advancing its development at the same time.

I would also like to thank Prof. Joseph Moysan, who is the co-adviser of this thesis and decided to sign me and bring me over from a country very far, and, during whole period of this Ph.D., he especially gave support to not only my study by his rich knowledge on acoustics but also making a living in France.

I am also grateful to Dr. Christian Lhuillier who supported me at CEA Cadarache and gave me his abundant knowledge and experience on acoustics and engineering in nuclear reactors.

For other members of the laboratories including CEA Cadarache DTN/STCP/LISM and CNRS Marseille LMA who kindly helped and warmly welcomed me, I thank as well.

I would also thank all juries of this Ph.D., Prof. Mounsif Ech-Cherif El-Kettani, Dr. Michel Darmon, Dr. Stéphane Lanteri, Dr. Antoine Gerschenfeld and Dr. Dominique Habault for their kind acceptance to be a jury, careful verification on my Ph.D. report and attending my defence.    

I thank Dr. Antoine Gerschenfeld and Dr. Pierre-Emmanuel Angéli (CEA/DANS/DM2S/STMF) who provided us the CFD calculation data and instructions on the visualization and interpolation tools which were essentials for obtaining our results and progressing our research.

I would also like to gratitude to Mr. Greg Sjaardema with Sandia National Laboratories, USA, for kindly supporting us on using EXODUS II mesh format and its management toolkit SEACAS.
