Figure \ref{fig:tfi_1d} shows the TFI values on the $x$ axis of $y$ = \SI{0.09}{\meter} at several altitudes (i.e. $z$ positions), and Figure \ref{fig:mixing_state} B represents these TFI curves drawn in the case of the 2D TFI field. %% DK DK : Masaru, please check this change (I did not understand the original sentence)

OK!

l. 482
%% DK DK I do not understand this:    In order to indicate the time transition of the impact point, arrows in red color is added with digits which show the order of the move of points.
(modified ↓)
In order to show temporal changes of the positions of impact points clearly, each dot (meaning positions of impact points) are linked by arrows in temporal order and digits are added for indicating the order of the positional changes.

l. 489
Namely, approximating the fluctuation of the acoustic celerity field using an isotropic Gaussian random process may not be very accurate for the regions where the jets keep their flows.
%% DK DK I do not understand "keep their flows"
(modified ↓)
Namely, approximating the fluctuation of the acoustic celerity field using an isotropic Gaussian random process may not be very accurate for the regions where the flow is still strong.

l.492
Part of this directivity effect may be caused by the geometry of PLAJEST, which has the same cross-sectional shape on the $y$ axis.
%% DK DK the same as what
(modified ↓)
Part of this directivity effect may be caused by the geometry of PLAJEST because the cross-sections on the $y$ axis of PLAJEST have always the same shapes.

l. 511
%% DK DK I did not understand what you meant by "the transient" in the whole chapter; I changed it to "the shape"; please check
OK!

l. 572
At the $x$ positions far from the acoustic source ($x$ = \SIlist{0.035;0.08;0.105}{\meter}), the differences of means between the $y$-$z$ center and the impact point are regarded.
%% DK DK I do not understand what you mean by "regarded" here, please change the word
(modified ↓)
At the $x$ positions far from the acoustic source ($x$ = \SIlist{0.035;0.08;0.105}{\meter}), the differences of means between the $y$-$z$ center and the impact point are found from Part 3.

l. 639
OK!

l. 641
OK!

l. 642
OK!

l. 647
% This is the reason why the mean time of flight at $x$ = \SI{-0.035}{\meter} has larger time of flight values at lower altitudes.
%% Masaru I did not understand what you meant in the sentence above
(modified ↓)
This is the reason why the mean time of flight curve at $x$ = \SI{-0.035}{\meter} has its peak at low altitude.

l. 650
On the other hand, around $x$ = \SI{0.035}{\meter}, the mean sound speed becomes higher when the altitude is low, and this causes the faster arrival of the mean time of flight.
%% Masaru: I do not understand the expression "the arrival of a mean time of flight" (a time of flight is already an arrival)
(modified ↓)
On the other hand, around $x$ = \SI{0.035}{\meter}, the mean sound speed becomes higher when the altitude is high, and this causes smaller values of the mean time of flight (\ref{fig:std_tof}, x: 0.035).

l. 705
%%    It is because by the randomize effect of isotropic Gaussian random field outputs the normal distribution of the fluctuation.
(modified ↓)
It is because the fluctuated values generated by isotropic Gaussian random field has always normal distribution but no directivity.

l. 707
OK!

Thank you very much!
